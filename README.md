# Mahara-Linkedin
The issue for Mahara Linkedin Plugin is I have students attempting to upload their Linkedin Profile URLs for the end of semester but it is taking forever to load. In some cases it doesn't load. Is there an update to the linkedin plugin for rev 18.04.2 we may have missed?
I was told by Kristina Hoeppner in Mahara Community support forum to file an issue with the pluin developer at github.com. It doesn't look like the plugin has been updated for Mahara 18.04+ yet.
Thank you.
